# Statiscial-Method-1
### Learning Outcomes:  
•Reformulate scientific or social problems into questions that can be answered by statistics.  
•Gather, criticize and pre-process data that is relevant to the statistical analysis.  
•Specify appropriate formal models (e.g., linear, generalized linear, hierarchical); evaluate their assump-  
tions within context; and perform sensitivity comparisons between models.  
•Convey the data, models and results in succinct, yet descriptive and additive ways.  
•Interpret the data, models and results in the context of the question and the appropriateness of each
stage of the analysis.  
•Present the data analysis in a clear, succinct narrative that is augmented by the appropriate graphics,
figures and tables.
### Course Description: 
Provides a thorough grounding in modern statistical methods. The specific learning outcomes for the course
are to understand data collection in context (how/why data were collected, key questions under study);  
explore data by effective graphical and numerical summaries; understand probability concepts and models
as tools for studying random phenomena and for statistical inference; analyze data using appropriate, modern
statistical models, methods, and software; understand the statistical concepts underlying methods; develop
the ability to interpret results and critically evaluate the methods used; communicate data analysis and key
findings in context.
